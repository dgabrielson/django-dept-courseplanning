    <h2>Make sure that all teaching faculty have teaching profiles</h2>

    <a href="{% url 'admin:course_planning_teachingprofile_changelist' %}">
        Home › Programs &amp; Course Info › Teaching profiles
    </a>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Make sure the person associated with the teaching profile
            has a username – login is required by each teaching
            faculty member to view or update their teaching profile.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setup additional teaching survey questions</h2>

    <a href="{% url 'admin:course_planning_teachingsurveyquestion_changelist' %}">
        Home › Programs &amp; Course Info › Teaching survey questions
    </a>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Additional survey questions are meant to provide
            further information regrading teaching.
        </li>
        <li>
            Example questions are: <br>
            &ldquo;Are there any other particulars you would like us to consider when assigning your teaching for this upcoming year?&rdquo;<br>
            &ldquo;Are there any graduate courses or topics courses you would like to propose?&rdquo;
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Setup programs for scheduling</h2>

    <a href="{% url 'admin:course_planning_program_changelist' %}">
        Home › Programs &amp; Course Info › Programs
    </a>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Programs that are used for scheduling are
            groups of courses that teaching faculty can rank
            their preferences for.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each program is one step in the teaching profile,
            so it's a good idea to have multiple programs for
            scheduling.
        </li>
        <li>
            All of the programs for scheduling should cover
            the entire undergraduate program.<br>
            Departments may or may not schedule graduate courses
            at the same time.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Distribute the teaching survey link</h2>

    <a href="{% url 'courseplanning-teaching-profile' %}">
        {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'courseplanning-teaching-profile' %}
    </a>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Everybody gets the same url, but login is required
            to identify the profile being updated.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Set up a draft schedule</h2>

    <a href="{% url 'admin:course_planning_draftschedulesession_add' %}">
        Home › Programs &amp; Course Info › Draft schedule sessions > Add
    </a>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Start by entering a name and the start and end
            dates for the draft schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
            At the moment, the scheduler is designed to allow scheduling up to
            one year with a single draft schedule – specifing a longer time
            period may have unpredicatible results.
        <li>
            Save using the &ldquo;Save and continue editing&rdquo; button.
        </li>
        <li>
            Intialize the schedule using one of the availabe options.
        </li>
        <li>
            Depending on the courses available, you may only have one
            available option for initalizing a draft schedule.
            This is normal.
        </li>
        <li>
            The &ldquo;Auto Schedule&rdquo; option is provided
            as a convience only – always review using the
            scheduling worksheet.
    </ul>



    <h2>Edit the draft sections</h2>

    <a href="{% url 'admin:course_planning_draftsection_changelist' %}">
        Home › Programs &amp; Course Info › Draft sections
    </a>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Using the filters, select the draft schedule and possibly
            the term you want to focus on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ensure that there are the desired courses and sections.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will need to manually update draft sections for courses
            that only run every other year (or irregularly).
        </li>

    </ul>



    <h2>Use the scheduling worksheet</h2>

    <a href="{% url 'admin:course_planning_draftschedulesession_changelist' %}">
        Home › Programs &amp; Course Info › Draft schedule sections
    </a>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Using the link above, click the &ldquo;Worksheet&rdquo; button.
        </li>
        <li>
            A large screen is helpful when using the worksheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clicking the <img src="/media/img/icons/info.svg" alt="Info"> icon
            beside a course name will show a list of instructor preferences
            for that course.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clicking an instructor from the right sidebar will show
            that instructors preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
            As courses are assigned instructors (and timeslots)
            scores and notes are updated, as is instructor load
            information in the right sidebar.
        </li>
        <li>
            For each assignment, higher scores represent more desireable
            options.
        </li>
    </ul>
